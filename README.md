# Prime-D
This KiCad project includes both the schematic and pcb-layout for FSI drop tower project "Prime-D".  This circuit board should be treated as an Arduino "Shield" and be placed on top of the Arduino Uno socket.

## Usage
This project requires KiCad Version 5.0 and after to use.

## Documents Folder
The documents folder contains;
  * [the bill of materials (BOM)](/KiCad%20Projects/PRIME-D/documents/BOM/)
  * [all of the components datasheets](/KiCad%20Projects/PRIME-D/documents/datasheets/)
  * [gerber files](/KiCad%20Projects/PRIME-D/documents/Gerbers/)
  * [pictures](/KiCad%20Projects/PRIME-D/documents/pictures/)
  * [previous revisions](/KiCad%20Projects/PRIME-D/documents/Revisions/)
  * [pdf of both the schematic and pcb layout](/KiCad%20Projects/PRIME-D/documents/schematic_n_PCBlayout/)

## Coming Soon
Again please note that this Prime-D circuit board should be treated as an Arduino Uno shield.  The software to program the arduino will be added to this repo soon.
